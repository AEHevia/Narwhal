  "summary": "Anteater is a common name for the four extant mammal species of the suborder Vermilingua (meaning \"worm tongue\") commonly known for eating ants and termites. The individual species have other names in English and other languages. Together with the sloths, they are within the order Pilosa. The name \"anteater\" is also colloquially applied to the unrelated aardvark, numbat, echidnas, pangolins and some members of the Oecobiidae.\nExtant species are the giant anteater Myrmecophaga tridactyla, about 1.8 m (5 ft 11 in) long including the tail; the silky anteater Cyclopes didactylus, about 35 cm (14 in) long; the southern tamandua or collared anteater Tamandua tetradactyla, about 1.2 m (3 ft 11 in) long; and the northern tamandua Tamandua mexicana of similar dimensions.",
  "facts": [
    "this is a tamandua, which diverged from the giant anteater 12.9 million years ago. they are still their closest relatives, and like the giant anteater, carry their babies on their backs. the mother sometimes will leave the babies on safe branches while they forage."
