Alligators first appeared during the Oligocene epoch about 37 million years ago.The name \"alligator\" is probably an anglicized form of el lagarto, the Spanish term for \"the lizard\", which early Spanish explorers and settlers in Florida called the alligator. Later English spellings of the name included allagarta and alagarto.",
